# Custom breakpoints

There are predefined breakpoint in Storefront UI but it is possible to define your own breakpoints for components.
You can decide if you want to change all breakpoints or only chosen ones.

## Predefined breakpoints

Predefined breakpoints in Storefront UI:

```css
$mobile-max: 767px;
$tablet-min: 768px;
$tablet-max: 1023px;
$desktop-min: 1024px;
$desktop-l-min: 1200px;
$desktop-xl-min: 1440px;
$desktop-xxl-min: 1920px;
```

Breakpoint between desktop and mobile view:

```css
$breakpoint: $desktop-min; // 1024px
```

## How to change breakpoints

### In the Nuxt project

You need to follow 3 steps:

1. Create a new file called `_variables.scss` in `assets/scss` folder. 
If you don't have these folders you can create them too.

2. Define your own breakpoints in the creadted file.
It can look like this example:

```css
$breakpoint: 600px;
```

3. Add a path to your custom breakpoints in `nuxt.config.js`

```js
styleResources: {
    scss: [..., '~/assets/scss/_variables.scss']
}
```

### In the Vue project

To effectively change the breakpoint in a Vue project you can utlize `change-breakpoint` script by running it inside `node_modules/@storefront-ui/vue` folder in your project, like this:
```
yarn change-breakpoint 800
```
You should pass the value of breakpoint without any unit. 

If you want to go back to default setting, just pass command without any value:
```
yarn change-breakpoint
```
<div class="alert warning">

Please, be aware that removing `node_modules` folder will cause resetting `$breakpoint` to default value so you will need to run the command with chosen breakpoint once again. 

</div>
