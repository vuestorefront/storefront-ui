# Custom breakpoints

There are predefined breakpoint in Storefront UI but it is possible to define your own breakpoints for components.
You can decide if you want to change all breakpoints or only chosen ones.

## Predefined breakpoints

Predefined breakpoints in Storefront UI:

```css
$mobile-max: 767px;
$tablet-min: 768px;
$tablet-max: 1023px;
$desktop-min: 1024px;
$desktop-l-min: 1200px;
$desktop-xl-min: 1440px;
$desktop-xxl-min: 1920px;
```

Breakpoint between desktop and mobile view:

```css
$breakpoint: $desktop-min; // 1024px
```

## How to change breakpoints

You need to follow 3 steps:

1. Create a new file called `_variables.scss` in `assets/scss` folder. 
If you don't have these folders you can create them too.

2. Define your own breakpoints in the creadted file.
It can look like this example:

```css
$breakpoint: 600px;
```

3. Add a path to your custom breakpoints in `nuxt.config.js`

```js
styleResources: {
    scss: [..., '~/assets/scss/_variables.scss']
}
```
