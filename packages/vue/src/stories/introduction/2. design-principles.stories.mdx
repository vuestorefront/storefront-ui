# Design Principles

Below are StorefrontUI's design principles.

## Design patterns

We use [**atomic design**](http://bradfrost.com/blog/post/atomic-web-design/) concept for grouping components (**without** templates and pages).

![Atomic design](https://res.cloudinary.com/mayashavin/image/upload/h_150/v1567776459/StorefrontUI/atomic-design.png)

In general, there are three groups of components:

- **Atoms** - Atoms are **the most basic and abstract** components for building other components, such as color palletes, icons, button, input, etc.
- **Molecules** - Molecules are components built from **groups of atoms bonded together**, take on their own properties and serve as the backbone of the design systems. Some good examples are a banner, gallery, menu item, etc.
- **Organisms** - Organisms are complex and distinct components built from **groups of molecules** joined together, such as header, grid, accordions, etc.

Before starting, please review our design concepts ad the components section to get familiar with our standards.

### Working with Figma

We use [Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/N0Ct95cSAoODNv7zYS01ng/Storefront-UI-%7C-Design-System?node-id=127%3A1054) to design the basic layouts of our component.

While working with our figma designs there are two concepts that you need to be familiar with:

1. All of the components (not always with the names same as in a code) can be found under 'components' section in left bottom corner.

2. Most of the components have style applied on them. It means that if you click
   on a text field of particular element you can find the name of a style (instead
   of raw color/size) referring to styleguide. You can find them in global SCSS
   vars.
