### Committing Changes

This repository automatically squashes commits from your branch into one when merging a pull request, so you do not need to worry about number of commits on your branch.
Commit messages and PR names should follow [Conventional Commits v1.0.0](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/). It important for our changelog & release notes generators to work properly.
