# Package release

Release process is automatic and it is done on CI with github actions. Versioning is done with [changesets](https://github.com/changesets/changesets) tool.

## How to release packages?

1. Create branch `v2-release/version` e.g `v2-release/4.0.0` with all changes you want to release, that will be merged into `v2` branch.
2. Autogenerated pull request will be created with changelog created by `changesets`.
3. If changelog is sufficient and it will be merged, that means we have all ingredients needed to release package.
4. After merging pull request with changelog we can freely **merge** (regular merge, not - squash and merge) our `v2-release/4.0.0` into `v2`, once this happens automatic publish of all packages will be done.
5. Last step required from user is to approve or resolve conflict of auto generated pull request with synchronized data from `v2` -> `v2-develop` so we would close full circle, and new changelog and bumped version would be available on `v2-develop`.
