Forms can be presented as dedicated pages or integrated within modals, cards, or side panels, with the form's context influencing its layout and vertical spacing. Typically, dedicated-page forms can accommodate greater complexity. This block use a responsive grid to drive layout decisions, ensuring optimal display across different screen sizes and devices. 

For further customization of layouts, we recommend referring to our documentation on Modal and Drawer pages.
