# Order Summary 

{{ $frontmatter.description }}

In this example there are two types of alerts: `positive` and `error`. 
The first one is shown in two cases:
- when a valid promo code - `VSF2020` is passed to the input and applied by clicking on the `Apply` button,
- when added promo code has been removed.
The second alert shows up when passed promo code is not valid.
