## Product Rating

The Product Rating block serves as a basic yet effective solution for implementing a 1-5 stars rating system commonly used in eCommerce platforms. It enables users to easily express their opinion about a particular item or experience.

It allows for customization through the use of RatingButton basic component. This feature permits users to provide more specific ratings, enhancing the granularity of their feedback.

For additional customizations and more advanced functionality, you can consult our documentation on the [Modal](/<!-- vue -->vue<!-- end vue --><!-- react -->react<!-- end react -->/components/modal.html) page.
