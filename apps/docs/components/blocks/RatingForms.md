## Product Rating

The Product Rating block serves as a basic yet effective solution for implementing a 1-5 stars rating system commonly used in eCommerce platforms. It enables users to easily express their opinion about a particular item or experience.

This block is implemented using `SfRatingButton` and `SfModal` components. If you need further customizations, see their docs pages.
