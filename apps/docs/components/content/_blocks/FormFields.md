# Form fields

The Form Fields block is designed to showcase the usage of various input types, such as Input, Checkbox, Radio, Select, SelectDropdown, Combobox, Button, etc., using a single form as an example. It demonstrates the application of required fields, indicated by an asterisk (*) next to the label, and handles error validation.

Forms can be presented as dedicated pages or integrated within modals, cards, or side panels, with the form's context influencing its layout and vertical spacing. Typically, dedicated-page forms can accommodate greater complexity. This block use a responsive grid to drive layout decisions, ensuring optimal display across different screen sizes and devices. 

For further customization of layouts, we recommend referring to our documentation on Modal and Drawer pages.
