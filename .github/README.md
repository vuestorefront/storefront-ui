# Storefront UI 2

<p align="center">

**Current status:** Under construction, not suitable for production.<br />
Accessible, performance-oriented and elegant out-of-the-box UI framework for eCommerce (and not only).
<br /><br />
Made with ❤️ by <a href="https://github.com/vuestorefront" target="_blank">Vue Storefront</a> team and contributors.

# What makes it unique?

StorefrontUI 2 was designed specifically for ecommerce. You can create stunning shops in a blink of an eye with these accessible, performsant, drop-in-ready components and the boilerplating system.

## Here are the key characteristics of Storefront UI:

We are building Storefront UI based on the following 6 fundamentals:

- **Customization**: You have full access to the code snippets. You can change whatever you like, we make it easier for you.
- **Accessibility**: Every component is compliant with AA level of WCAG standard.
- **Performance**: You're using only what you need for your project, even if it's just one component. No JS, no complicated logic, just plain UI as it's best.
- **Best practices**: Storefront UI components follow best practices in terms of design and core.
- **E-commerce**: As a UI library dedicated to eCommerce, Storefront UI along with standard UI components has all the elements necessary for building modern online stores.
- **Open Source**: Storefront UI is a community effort to deliver the best possible experience to modern web applications and e-commerce shops, with carefully crafted components following best practices. Our team consists of agencies and volunteer contributors from all over the world.

# Design

Storefront UI 2 was made to make developer-designer work easier for both. You can find the stunning designs we are using [here](https://www.figma.com/file/CWOkbpne0tDpSenT4ZEUTQ/%F0%9F%9B%A0-SFUI-2.0-%7C-Development?node-id=10066%3A27483).
